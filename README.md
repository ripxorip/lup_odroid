# The LUP Odroid H3+ Chassis 
I recently got an Odroid H3+ and desperately needed a chassis for it so I decided to make one. Since I am a long-time listener and a **big fan** of the [Linux Unplugged podcast](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linux-unplugged/) I wanted to pay tribute to it. The STL files are available under `stl/`. If you get some value out of this, please consider supporting **Jupiter Broadcasting** with some boosts/donations.

I wanted it to have roughly the same layout as a Mac mini which left me with quite some unused space. To practice some CAD and add ventilation I designed a fan system with 2 Noctua NF-A4x20 and a couple of ducts. I also have a WIP version which features room for a couple of 2.5" drives.
